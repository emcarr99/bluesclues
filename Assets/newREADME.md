## Description
The goal of this challenge was to create a README generator using Node.js and two different npm packages. 

## Installation
To use this application you will need to clone this repo. Once cloned, in your code editor you will need to open the intergrated terminal and then run the program by the command "node index.js"

## Usage
Open intergrated terminal and run "node index.js" command and then answer all questions (like I did to create this README)!
