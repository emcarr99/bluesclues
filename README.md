## Description
The goal of this challenge was to create a README generator using Node.js and two different npm packages. 

## Installation
To use this application you will need to clone this repo. Once cloned, in your code editor you will need to open the integrated terminal and then run the program by the command "node index.js"

## Usage
Link to video demo: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wCOyB7ZFxkf4EGiQ1Wihp8HnLw1iw64R/view?usp=share_link

Right click on the 'index.js' file to open integrated terminal and run "node index.js" command and then answer all questions (like I did to create this README)!
